Therefore, it is likely that whatever naval conflict occurred in the H[ag_ancient_delta_star.GetName]! system is not related to the civil war of the Ancient Empire.

Bearing the designation of design #0259 in the Nebula Project, it appears to be a structure similar to a standard Ion Cannon design mixed with a defensive platform. \n\nUsing the information gleaned from the analysis of the after-action reports of our fleets, this ancient turret has striking similarities with the ancient weapons platform that we encountered in H[ag_ancient_delta_star.GetName]! previously, yet, with two vital differences - this weapons platform design is both independently mobile and is equipped with a previously undocumented form of jump-drive, with heretofore unseen capabilities. Our office of Naval Intelligence noted in their reports on the combat against the hostile turrets in the H[ag_ancient_delta_star.GetName]! system, despite their similar external appearance, had a far lower combat potential than design #2059. \n\nSince our existing fabrication facilities cannot manufacture ancient designs due to the exotic materials required, we currently have no way to independently manufacture such weapon prototypes in our own facilities. Thankfully, our [Root.GetScienceTeam] found one other major item of interest in their analysis of the databank: schematics for a structure called a \"H$ag_construction_section$!\", clearly designed for the creation of space-faring vessels.

 ag_space_mine_field_megastructure_DESC:0 "A minefield deployed near the central celestial body of the star system. It has the ability to distinguish between friend or foe, and can actively damage enemy ships. The gravitational manipulation equipment in this minefield may be damaged by attacking or destroying ships. If there is a lot of damage in a short period of time, the minefield may be destroyed, resulting in a large explosion that will damage all ships in the star system. This damage will mainly be concentrated on enemy ships. Damage to equipment can slowly recover when not attacking enemy ships."
